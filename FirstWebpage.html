<h1> Vikas Dave </h1>

<p> As a Full Stack Developer, I am skilled in both front-end and back-end development, making me proficient in building, deploying, and maintaining web applications across all layers of the stack.
     I have the ability to work on the client-side for an engaging user experience while also managing the server-side for efficient and secure data handling. 
    My diverse skill set allows me to manage everything from design to deployment, ensuring seamless performance of applications. </p> 

    <h2>Front-End Development </h2>
    <p>I excel in crafting user interfaces that are both visually appealing and highly functional. 
    Using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React or Angular, I create responsive, dynamic web pages that prioritize user experience.</p>

        <p>I ensure that my web applications perform consistently across multiple browsers, using testing tools to address compatibility issues.</p>

    <h2>Back-End Development </h2>
    I am adept at building and managing the server side of applications. 
    With expertise in languages such as Node.js, Python, or Ruby, and experience with databases like SQL and NoSQL, I ensure smooth data management and server operations to support the applicationâ€™s functionality.

        <h3>Server-Side Languages</h3>
        <p>I work with languages like Node.js, Python, and Ruby to handle back-end logic, manage APIs, and interact with databases.</p>
        <h3>Database Management</h3>
        <p>I am experienced with both SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.</p>
        <h3>API Development</h3>
        <p>I develop RESTful APIs that allow front-end applications to communicate with the server efficiently, ensuring that data flows smoothly between client and server.</p>
        <h3>Authentication & Security</h3>
        <p>I implement secure authentication systems and follow best practices in data protection, using tools like OAuth, JWT, and HTTPS to secure applications against common vulnerabilities.</p>
    
    <h2>DevOps and Deployment </h2>
    In addition to coding, I manage the deployment and infrastructure of applications. 
    I leverage tools like Git, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud services like AWS or Azure to deploy, monitor, and maintain my applications effectively, ensuring they run reliably across different environments.

        <h3>Version Control with Git</h3>
        <p>I use Git for version control, enabling me to collaborate with teams, track changes, and manage different versions of the project efficiently.</p>
        <h3>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</h3>
        <p>I automate the testing and deployment process using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Travis CI, ensuring that updates are deployed quickly and reliably.</p>
        <h3>Cloud Services</h3>
        <p>I leverage cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud for hosting applications, ensuring scalability and reliability in production environments.</p>
        <h3>Containerization and Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Using Docker and Kubernetes, I package applications in containers to streamline deployment and ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.</p>
